# Terraform on GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

## Setup GCP Project and Service Account 

GCP Setup for Terrafrom has below 3 steps. 

- Create a project 
- Create a service account and specify the compute admin role.
- Download the generated JSON file and save it to your projectâ€™s directory.

## Terraform Configuration 

Here is the configuration for setting up CGP Provider

```sh

    terraform {
    required_providers {
        google = {
        source  = "hashicorp/google"
        version = "3.5.0"
        }
    }
    }

    provider "google" {
    credentials = file(var.GCP_CRED_FILE_NAME)
    project     = var.GCP_PROJECT_ID
    region      = var.GCP_REGION
    zone        = var.GCP_ZONE
    }

```

and Variable values are 

```sh
    GCP_PROJECT_ID     = "weighty-wonder-308406"
    GCP_REGION         = "us-central1"
    GCP_ZONE           = "us-central1-a"
    GCP_CRED_FILE_NAME = "Terraform-project-b21d170ea375.json"
```

With this now we are ready to create GCP resources with Terrafrom. 


# Create first GCP Resource 

to Valdiate our configuration and to test below GCP resoruces we are going to create. 

```sh
    ## Create a VPC network
    resource "google_compute_network" "vpc_network" {
    name = "terraform-network"
    }

    ## Create a VM instance
    resource "google_compute_instance" "app-instance" {
    name         = "test-app-server"
    machine_type = "f1-micro"
    zone         = var.GCP_ZONE

    boot_disk {
        initialize_params {
        image = "debian-cloud/debian-9"
        }
    }

    network_interface {
        network = google_compute_network.vpc_network.id

    }
    }

    ## Create a storage bucket
    resource "google_storage_bucket" "test-bucket" {
    name = "sumitgupta28-testbucket-xxx"
    }
```


and if we perform **terrafrom init** , **terrafrom plan** and **terrafrom apply** , below apply outout will created a 
VPC network and VM Instance and a storage bucket. 

```sh

        $ terraform apply

        An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
        Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
        + create

        Terraform will perform the following actions:
